# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (2026-08-18)

- Tattoos, skin, face paint, beards and other body overlays can be replaced by putting the
  `.ytd` straight into `tex_overrides`, without any folder. The file replaces the one texture
  with the same name. Any name is accepted, so custom server tattoo packs work too.
- Tattoos can be moved, resized and rotated by putting an edited `overlays.xml` into
  `tex_overrides`. Before changing anything, the plugin checks that the file still matches the
  running game, and skips the file if it does not line up.
- Added `docs/overlay_index.tsv`, a table of all 3,921 tattoos and overlays in the base game. For
  each one it lists the file that owns it, its position, size, rotation, and the texture name.
- The hook is installed earlier now, while FiveM is still loading and before the game has run any
  code, so nothing can be executing the code being patched. The old approach tried to pause all
  threads first, which FiveM blocks anyway.
- Rewrote the README and COLLECTIONS.md in plainer English.

## 0.2.0

- First public version: clothing replacement per collection folder, claim and re-assert at the
  streaming layer, full logging.
